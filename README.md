# COMS-4733-Computational-Aspects-of-robotics
Home work problem for the course of computational aspects of robotics. 


Hw-1: Creating the Minkowski Polygon from 2 polygons (input). {we input their vertices as a list of points}
      Implementing A bug-2 algorithm,{you input obstacle vertices and the start and stop positions of the bug}


HW-2: Creating Bushfire map, extracting GVD path from the bush fire map. 
      and finally taking two points anywhere on the map and using the GVD to obtain the optimum path between the two points.
