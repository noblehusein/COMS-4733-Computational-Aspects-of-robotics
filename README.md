# COMS-4733-Computational-Aspects-of-robotics
Home work problem for the course of computational aspects of robotics. 


Hw-1: Creating the Minkowski Polygon from 2 polygons (input). {we input their vertices as a list of points}
      Implementing A bug-2 algorithm,{you input obstacle vertices and the start and stop positions of the bug}


HW-2: Creating Bushfire map, extracting GVD path from the bush fire map. 
      and finally taking two points anywhere on the map and using the GVD to obtain the optimum path between the two points.

HW-3: Codding normal and greedy RRT algorithm in python. And also the Kalman Filter Problem

HW-4: We take a more detailed look at the EKF problem and also explore the Particle filter problem.

HW-5: We explore the two diffferent types of Iterative Inverse Kinematics methods used to find solutions to a given problem and we also write a code for    
      a Neural Network that can learn this Inverse Kinematics Problem
